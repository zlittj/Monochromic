# Monochromic
A custom theme for Jellyfin mediaserver created using CSS overrides. 

To use the theme copy paste the line below into "Dashboard>General>Custom CSS" and click save, it will apply immediately server-wide to all users on top of any theme they may be using. To remove the theme, clear the "Custom CSS" field and then click save.
```css
@import url('https://zlittj.github.io/Monochromic/default_style.css');
```

NOTE: This may not work when using reverse proxy, check below the screenshots for more info.

## Features
- Uses the same font as the JF logo everywhere
- Blurred backdrops
- Squared aesthetic with rounded corners (optionally corners so sharp you might get an eye poked out)
- Works well on mobile
- Strives to theme every element
- More compact
- Smaller and squared cast info
- Customizable accent color

## Add-ons

There are some additional options, that allow for an accent color, or removed rounding. These are added immediately after the default import line.

```css
@import url('https://zlittj.github.io/Monochromic/sharp_style.css');
```

Removes corner rounding. In fact, squares off  every rounded corner JF ever had.

```css
@import url('https://zlittj.github.io/Monochromic/jfblue_style.css');
```

Restore some of the jellyfin blue accenting.

```css
@import url('https://zlittj.github.io/Monochromic/customcolor_style.css');
:root {--accent: replaceme;}
:root {--hoveraccent: replaceme80;}
```

Define your own accent color. Use a [hex code selector](https://www.hexcolortool.com/) to find your color. Replace the "replaceme" with the hex. The 80 should be left there, extending the code you chose, it adds the transparency.

## Using with reverse proxy

When using the Nginx Reverse proxy config from the [Jellyfin docs](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/nginx.html) the theme will not work by default. (If you are using the subpath config, you can ignore all this.)

Because the config includes Content-Security-Policy which reduces risk of XSS, you need to add the URL from this repo and the fonts to the list of allowed external sources.

In the nginx config you should change the
```
add_header Content-Security-Policy ....
```
to:
```
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src https: data: blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/default_style.css https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/sharp_style.css https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/jfblue_style.css https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/customcolor_style.css https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.gstatic.com/cv/js/sender/v1/cast_sender.js https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api https://s.ytimg.com https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/default_style.css https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/sharp_style.css https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/jfblue_style.css https://ctalvio.github.io/Monochromic/customcolor_style.css; worker-src 'self' blob:; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'";
```

If you don't do this the theme will simply not load (reverts back to default theme) and the browser console will spit out an error. Even if you paste in all the CSS, the font will still not load since it is loaded from an external source.

Thanks to [LickABrick](https://github.com/LickABrick) for discovering this, and submitting instructions on how to fix.
